	    <h3><p>Profile</p></h3>
	        
	        <div>I have worked in technology for the better part of a decade and have loved every single second of it. My passion for computers, software, and combining the two to create something fun was what got me recruited to Apple. During my time at Apple I took every opportunity to learn more about anything I could read, understand, and show other people. I was fortunate enough to bring that passion to Squarespace, where I have been learning the other side of technology, from hardware and software all the way to web development. Along with my passion for technology, I also have a passion [obsession] for my cat, collecting tons of clocks, knitting, playing World of Warcraft, watching the rain, and eating amazing Portland food while playing cribbage.</div>
	        
	        
	        
	<h3><p>Experience</p></h3>
	    <ul>
	    <li><p>Squarespace - 2 years</li>
	    	<ul><li>
	    	My responsibilities at Squarespace are to ensure that our customers are satisfied with and understand how to use our platform, as well as everything inside of it. I craft clean emails that are easy to read, have step-by-step instructions that make sense regardless of the customer’s knowledge base, and hopefully uplift them as well. I started in our Level 1 (L1) queue, which took the platform’s more basic tickets, such as billing issues, design options, interface support, troubleshooting, and escalating tickets to higher level or specialty queues when they left L1’s scope of support. In that time I learned all of our systems, services, procedures, and policies while continuing to be productive and efficient, while maintaining the same level of support for my customers. A month ago I was recommended for, and received, a promotion into our L2 queue.

My responsibilities have shifted since moving to our L2 queue; I have similar goals, but I am also used as a resource to new hires, other people in the L2 queue, and I work closely with my Escalations Testing Team to find and report bugs, share detailed notes and screen shots. My new role is fantastic; not only do I get to help my customers every day, but I get to flex my multitasking muscles to assist peers while I also manage my own tickets. I am a firm believer that exceptional results follow equally exceptional behavior; achieving company goals is merely a reflection of how much we care for our customers.

	    <li><p>Apple - 7 years</p></li>
	    	<ul><li>I joined Apple in November of 2007 because I had a passion for the brand and culture. As an Apple Expert, I spent 7 years upholding the highest level of support and service by delivering world class experiences to my customers. I brought energy, a hard work ethic, a high level of customer focus, and a drive for results to my team. I repaired and strengthened relationships with customers by listening to their needs and guiding them to a solution with terminology that was clear, concise, and detailed, without being overwhelming. I believe in helping people by being efficient, caring, and tactful so that they feel competent but still in charge. I frequently took ownership of customers who needed extra support, I understand that ownership and follow-through is how you build a rapport for yourself and the company you represent. I consistently received top results in customer feedback year over year for all three teams I was a part of.</li></ul>
